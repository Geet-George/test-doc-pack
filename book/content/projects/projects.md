# Projects 

Each student designs their own project. You "propose" the project. The teaching staff will go through these projects and will give feedback on the feasibility and suggest any modifications. You can look at [some project themes here](themes.md) to get ideas for the types of projects you can do, but don't feel restricted to them.

The primary objective of your project is to be able to use version control and package the source code with standard practices in software of testing and documentation. The subject matter of the code is secondary (but not unimportant!). Put simply, the code itself should be functioning, even if the content is not perfect. 

For example, if your project aims to predict the weather using a simple linear regression model on temperature, pressure, humidity and winds, you should be able to provide source code that can be run by anyone, and the source code should be well-documented and tested. How well the model can actually predict the weather becomes secondary.

For your project, you will be working on your own project in Gitlab (hosted by TU Delft). This project is part of your submission of your proposed project. Details on how to do this are provided below.

## Proposal Requirements and Deadline

**The deadline for submitting your proposal is 19th September, 10:00 CEST.**

In [Gitlab hosted by TU Delft](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/) you should be able to login with your NetID. Create a new (blank) project on Gitlab. Give it an appropriate name. You can set any visibility level, however if you choose "Private", you must add the instructor and all TAs as members in the project. Initialize the repository with a README, and in this `README.md`, you will write down 

i. a brief description of the project

ii. the algorithm / library / methods that you want to use

iii. the data that you will need

iv. the expected outcome. 

The whole description should not be more than 400 words.

To complete the aforementioned tasks, you will need to first understand a few small things about `git`. Think of this as a small exercise to build up your git basics, which you will find very useful in the course and much much beyond. You'll find a [quick guide to using git here](../learning/quick-guide-to-git.md), including cloning your repository from Gitlab to your computer locally and then committing your changes.

Commit the additions in the `README` to your project, after which the teaching team will be able to view it and provide you with feedback.
