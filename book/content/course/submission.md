# Project submission

Now that you've finished your project, it is time to submit it. Project submissions should be done on GitHub by raising an "issue" ON YOUR OWN REPOSITORY. A quick guide to raising a GitHub Issue can be found [here](../learning/guide-to-raising-issues.md). 

By submitting your project like this, everything stays contained and easy to find, for yourself and the teaching staff. Furthermore, in the raised submission issue you can easily include ancillary info relevant for grading, such as screenshots, descriptions etc.

The submission issue is wonâ€™t be graded, but if requirements are not followed, your project might not be evaluated or it might have potential point deductions.


## Template for submission

```
### 1. Submission Overview

Briefly explain the project for context (1 sentence). We don't expect you to copy paste the content of your README. 

### 2. Project Screenshots

Include a screenshot with your project working as desired (or with errors, if it doesn't work).

### 3. Pytest Screenshots

Include a screenshot of the pytest output

### 4. Miscellaneous Notes or Comments

Here you can inform us if something doesnt work. Did your pytest or python function fail but you can't find out why? Are there problems relating to the commit history or git branches? Explain what you tried and or what you believe the root cause might be!
```

## Make sure you...
- Title your issue as `Final Submission {course code} {student number}`, e.g.: `Final Submission AESB2122 12345678`
- Tag the teaching staff (otherwise they don't get a submission notification!)
- Include screenshots!
